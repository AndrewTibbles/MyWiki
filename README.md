# Django 2.2 project for unit 27

### This project will be in the form of a Wiki

## Test User Admin Login Credentials

### Username: Admin
### Password: Admin

## Error Logging
---
### To test 404 and 500 errors on the site, use the extension '/errors/407', '/errors/404' and '/errors/500'
### This will log only 404 and 500 errors to the MyWiki/MyWiki/logs/debug.log.
### I have also styled the file to look more prosentable and readable including the use of a timestamp.
